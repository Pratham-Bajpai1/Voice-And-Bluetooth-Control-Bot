# Voice and Bluetooth Control Bot using IoT ü§ñüéôÔ∏èüîµ 

Welcome to the Voice and Bluetooth Control Bot project! This bot can be controlled by both voice commands and through a smartphone application via Bluetooth connection. Let's dive into the details of this exciting project.

## Project Overview

In this project, we've created a bot that can be controlled by voice commands and a smartphone application connected via Bluetooth. The bot is built using various components:

- **Arduino Nano**: The brain of the bot.
- **Bluetooth Module**: Enables communication with a smartphone.
- **Gear Motors**: Drive the bot's movement.
- **Robot Wheels**: Facilitate movement.
- **Battery Holder**: Powers the bot.
- **Battery/Cell**: Power source.
- **PCB Design**: Custom circuit board for electronics.
- **Capacitors**: For smoothing electrical signals.

## How It Works

The bot operates on two modes of control:

1. **Voice Control:** Users can control the bot by speaking commands like UP, DOWN, STOP, LEFT, and RIGHT.
   
2. **Bluetooth Control:** Users can also control the bot using a smartphone application (any arduino bluetooth control application). By connecting to the bot via Bluetooth, users can drive it using the application's interface.

## Hardware Setup

1. **Assemble Components:** Gather all the hardware components listed above.
2. **Build the Bot:** Use the components to build the bot according to your design.
3. **Connect Components:** Wire up the Arduino Nano, Bluetooth module, motors, wheels, and power source according to the circuit diagram or PCB design.

## Voice Control Programming

Programming the bot for voice control involves:

- **Speech Recognition:** Implementing a speech recognition algorithm on the Arduino Nano to interpret voice commands.
- **Command Execution:** Mapping recognized commands to corresponding bot movements (UP, DOWN, STOP, LEFT, RIGHT).

## Bluetooth Control Setup

1. **Install Bluetooth Control Module App:** Download and install any arduino bluetooth control application from playstore on your smartphone.
2. **Connect via Bluetooth:** Pair the smartphone with the bot's Bluetooth module.
3. **Control the Bot:** Use the application's interface to drive the bot in various directions.
